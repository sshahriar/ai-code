# MCP Servers Explained Hosts, Clients, and Discovery for Claude Code

> Week 2 · Day 3

## Overview

Okay, I've got a few minutes to do some technical stuff on MCP that is like optional. Many of you may notice already.

Some of you may not know and may not care because it's not necessary to get through the using it. But for those that do care, the next couple of minutes are for you, some technicalities about MCP.

The terminology isn't that important for using it in Cloud Code. We're not going to build MCP.

## Key concepts

### Foundations

We're going to just use it. But you might as well know these are terms you've probably already heard. There are these three things that people talk about with MCP.

The MCP host, the MCP client, the MCP server. The MCP host is the name of the overall AI application, which is running, which needs to call tools. And so, Cloud Code is an example of an MCP host.

Chat GPT is an MCP host. If you're writing your own agentic app like we do in my agentic track of my AI engineer course, we use open AI agent sstk and that as an application, the software is an mcp host. That's the mcp host.

The mcp client is a bit of code that runs within the mcp host where there's one of them for each of the sets of tools that you're using. And that is, again, that is something that's part baked into a Cloud Code or OpenAI Agencies DK or Chat GPT and so on. And then finally, the thing that you actually really care about is called the MCP server.

And that is the thing that manages the set of tools written by somebody else. So what they give you is an MCP server, an MCP server for browsing the internet, an MCP server for looking up stock prices. These are each MCP servers, and they give you a little description of it, and that's what you take, and you give it to your MCP host, like Claude Code, and it takes that description of an MCP server, and it knows what to do.

It knows how to set up a client, it knows how to launch that server, it knows how to run it. That's what's going on when you use MCP. And then the other technicality is that they can run in two different modes, perhaps two different techniques.

It's known as the different transports. It can run locally, in which case, it's running on your computer. The MCP server, this thing which is gonna look up market data or whatever, is running on your computer, or it can run remotely, which means it's running up on the cloud.

So if it's a JIRA-related one, maybe Atlassian is running it. If it's GitHub, we'll use GitHub's, maybe Microsoft or GitHub are running it on their servers and you're connecting remotely to it. And there are even in there that sort of subdivides.

There are two different techniques. One is called SSE and is now a legacy has been replaced, but still works. And one of them is streamable HTTP, which is the new way.

SSE is deprecated, but you can still use it. And the thing is that there is a big sort of confusion about this that I want to try and nicks right now. So it's a huge sort of confusion that some people have that when I say that this is these are local or remote MCP servers, I'm referring as I say to where the MCP servers actually run on your computer or or running remotely.

That's that's where the thing that that figures out what tools you've got access to and what you can do with those tools. But often the implementation of those tools involves making a web call. So just because the tools are running on your computer doesn't mean you're not accessing online services in some way.

For example, the market data one that we're going to try in a second that looks up stock prices. It's a local tool that runs, the MCP server runs on my computer. But for sure, it's looking up stock prices on the internet.

The stock prices aren't on my computer. So just because it runs locally doesn't mean it's not connecting remotely in some way as part of its implementation. So that's one source of confusion.

And the other confusion is that people sometimes think that because it's a local MCP server, and by the way, most MCP servers are local MCP servers, they think in some way that that's not real MCP, that you're not sharing. It wasn't written by somebody else. But that's all a confusion.

A local, it's still completely, all the benefits of MCP applies. That code that's running locally will still have been fetched from a remote repository. It's been installed probably either with something like PIP or with UV, a modern version, or with something like MPX, if it's a node, a JavaScript program.

It's been installed locally in your computer, but from a shared place, and's been installed locally in your computer, but from a shared place and then it's running on your computer. So it's just about where it actually runs, but it's still shared code, a shared tool written by somebody else. It's just about whether you're accessing it on the cloud or accessing it running on your computer.

### Deep dive

So as I say, not super important, but I do like to bring clarity to this. And just so that you understand, most MCP servers actually are local, but you've still got all the benefits of MCP and it still might well be connecting online. And that's the difference between MCP host, MCP client, and MCP server.

And often when you hear someone saying, I'm using this MCP, that's shorthand for saying, I'm using this MCP server. So at this point, we're gonna go and experiment with MCP servers before we move on to skills. One of the things that's kind of odd, that's sort of funky about MCP, is that it's not a super standard way to discover MCP servers, other people have written.

It's given you this great way to connect together, but it's not like there's been a kind of sort of everyone converging on one place to find MCP servers. There are a bunch of different marketplace sites, a lot of them, and there are thousands, tens of thousands, lots of MCP servers available, including very popular ones. But it's a little bit of a Wild West to understand how to navigate them.

And of course I will put links in the resources and this stuff changes all the time. But let's go and look at some right now and then we'll use a couple of them in Cloud Code. Now this first site is called registry.modeledcontextprotocol.io.

That is the official MCP website. And MCP by the way, I should say at this point, anthropic has donated it, as they say, to the Linux Foundation. So they've now made sure that it's got complete open source governance.

So this is the website for the official MCP registry. But it's, in my opinion, there's some crickets around this. It's a bit quiet.

It's not actually the most active of the places that you go to find MCP servers. Perhaps because there's not enough, it's kind of everything is here and it's kind of hard to navigate around. Another place you could go is a website that is part of a GitHub repo that anthropic put together with reference MCP servers.

It has some ones that they wrote in the early days that I've used a lot that lots of people use. And then there are some ones that are official ones made by third parties that are great place to go for ones that have kind of been blessed by anthropic here. So I often start by looking on this list and experimenting with some of these.

But there are separate to this, some websites that operate marketplaces, place where people can post their MCP servers, where people can write kind of reviews and there are ratings and things like that. And those are the most active places to go to get your mcp information. Let's look at three of them now.

So first up is this one here mcp.so and again I'll have links to these in the resources and you can see that it's like a marketplace that shows the different mcp servers that are available with like a search and keywords and tags and all the usual stuff. They've got 17,000 MCP servers. That's a lot.

Let me bring up one that we'll look at in a second. It's very popular for using Encloed Code, which is called context seven. And the idea is that one of the problems with Claude Code is that it doesn't have up-to-date information about APIs.

And often assumes APIs are current as of the-- it's training cut off. And so it's useful to be able to equip it with a tool that will inform it about the latest APIs. And that's what context seven does.

It allows it, allows the LLM to allow Claude Opus to ask, okay, brief me on this package, this library, and it will respond with the latest information about that library. So it's a really useful one to know. Now looking for this one called context seven immediately illuminates a classic problem with these marketplaces that they're full of noise, back comes tons of different versions of context seven, including one that says it's an unofficial MCP server, a context seven clone, things that look dubious.

And I just happen to know that the right one is this one, 'cause I recognize that logo. And if we click into it you can see that the maker is upstash and I happen to know that they are indeed the authors of context 7 but you kind of have to know that. Now fear not when we get to plugins you'll see that there is a way that there can be a better discovery mechanism but for mcp servers discovery is something that comes from doing research, from exploring things.

There is here a comments section where you can leave comments and you can look for people's reviews of something but it's empty. That's not much good. So this is mcp.so which is usually okay.

And next up is glamour.ai, glamour.ai which has a bunch of different things in it. And we are looking here in the mcp directory where we can click on servers to come straight into their servers and you'll see it's been updated very recently for me. It's got 16,000 servers or a bit less than MCP.SO.

### Putting it together

And I like the way they have this security, license and quality rating of things. You can see how much it's been downloaded, how much it's been favorited. So this is definitely a more thriving marketplace, I would say, but let's do the same test.

Let's look for context seven here. And here we go. Well, again, you see that there's a bunch of them.

You still have to know that Upstash is the right one. And some of them all have several triple-- three of them, at least, have a triple A rating. No, four of them.

But I know that this is the right one. I can click into this. And we can see information about this.

And we can see that there is also a link to their actual GitHub where they have it. And you can see that they've got information about how to use it, including specifically how to use it in Cloud Code. And you can see that the instructions for Cloud Code have specifically one if you want to do it remotely and one if you want to do it remotely and one if you want to do it locally.

The two different transport mechanisms that both work, both have the same benefits just whether the mcp server runs on my box or in the cloud. So that is, this is the specific command line command that we will use to equip cloud code with this mcp server, it's as simple as that. It's just a command that will run in a terminal, and that will bolt these tools into Claude code.

It's that simple. And I just wanna double down on this point that the big deal with mcp, the big deal comes down to the fact that there is this one line of code, one command that you run in a terminal, and after running that command, now Claude code has been equipped with a new set of tools. In this case, it's tools to do something quite specific about telling Cloud about latest APIs, but there could be many other things, like retrieving market data or other things, different sets of tools, and with a single line, it's just suddenly means that Cloud Code has that ability.

That is the kind of Eureka. That's the big deal about MCP and the reason people love it so much. It's not like it's a super ingenious thing.

It's just that everyone's adopted this standard, making it really easy. And the other point I want to make is that if you want to know whether or not an MCP server is legit, I was sort of jokey about it earlier. It's like, how do you tell?

You just know the name of the person that made it. Well, the best way is the same as any other open source software, like something you might pimp install, anything like that. Go to the source, go to GitHub.

If you scroll down here for a start, they've got a little advert for themselves in a way. They've got this little star history thing to show that UpStash/Contact7 has got quite a few GitHub stars. I think earlier I said that there was a GitHub link above, which was wrong.

The GitHub link is right over here. You can see it just here to the GitHub repo. And if you click there, we flip over to the GitHub repo.

Here we are in Upstash context seven. This is the GitHub repo. You can see it does indeed have more than 40,000 stars.

That's a good sign. You can see about the GitHub issues.

We're going to just use it. But you might as well know these are terms you've probably already heard. There are these three things that people talk about with MCP.

## Practical tips

- So as I say, not super important, but I do like to bring clarity to this. And just so that you understand, most MCP servers actually are local, but you've still got all the benefits of MCP and it still might well be connecting online. And that's the difference between MCP host, MCP client, and MCP server.

## Common pitfalls

- Skipping setup steps called out early in the lesson
- Copying outcomes without understanding the workflow behind them
- Running ahead without verifying intermediate results

## Summary

You can look through them if you wanted. You can see that it was last updated 10 hours ago or something So it's clearly got a lot of traction It gives you a good sense that this is actively maintained and then this is the the read me that's always worth looking at and you can see In here it will tell us exactly how to install it It's got the same advert again, and I'm sure it will tell us in here the the ways to install it. Yes in Claude code It's got the same commands right here, you could take it straight here from GitHub as well. So that's the kind of authoritative source to make sure you're satisfied with the MCP server that you're about to add to Cloud Code.

> Week 2 · Day 5

## Overview

Here we go. Now we're going to do the feature dev feature dev feature dev and just put down and tab and then I'm going to say implement jira ticket PL4 and make a PL.

That's it. That's all we're doing.

Off it goes. It's connected to Alastair.

## Key concepts

### Foundations

It's pulling PL4 and things are happening. I will see you back here in a bit. I know I'm going to be amazed and shocked.

Let's see what happens. Okay, it's come back and ask me questions like before. The first one it's saying is that for this V1 foundational ticket, should authentication be functional or just have placeholder routes?

And it should be placeholder only, which I thought we were clear about in the ticket, but maybe not enough. So I'm going to move to placeholder only. That's that question.

For the front and back end integration, should the current NDA form functionality remain client-side or should the form data be safe, persisted to the back end? Let's keep it client-side. And that's it.

That's the end of our questions. Off it goes. Back to thinking.

Okay, it's now following the steps more precisely. It's got to the architecture design and it's asking me to review this. If you look at the bottom here, it says, does this architecture approach look good to proceed with the implementation?

So let's have a look at it. Let me see. I have a clearer sense.

Here we go. Static front end. Fast API, that's good.

Front end next, JS static, that's fine. Fast API with UV, SQLite for future use, yes. Place all the routes only, yes.

Single container, multi-build, yes, that's what I like. This all looks good. Pyproject.tomal, I'm pleased to see.

That's what it didn't do before, that I didn't like, this seems sensible. That's sensible, this is a good structure. Oh, I hope that that's not going to be.

Oh, yeah, it's got roots. Okay, yeah, yeah, I like that. I like that Docker compose is good.

Fine. And this is all makes sense to me. I think this is good.

Add the database to get ignored. That's very sensible. Okay, I think this is this is good.

That that all looks very sensible. Now, of course, if you are not familiar with these technical decisions, then that's good because it's got a chat with me, chat about this thing where you can ask questions, probe. This is where, even if you're not from a technical background, you need to be the boss, be like the inquisitive manager that asks some probing questions to make absolutely sure you understand the different decisions, 'cause this is your opportunity to challenge.

And you know, increasingly it's getting better and better. It's hard to find fault in this, but had it done this before in our prior project, PM, I would have noticed that it was had a monolithic main dot pie and other other problems with it that I would have seen ahead of time. But it's not making that mistake now, perhaps because it's been guided through this process.

Okay, so I'm pressing one, yes, proceed. And off it goes. Well that's incredible.

It says that it's done everything. It says that it's tested it, all 76 tests pass, it says, and the API endpoints are done and that it's completed everything and it's made a PR. And so I guess we should now test it ourselves.

And then we can move on to the next. If we believe it, let's find out. We've got ourselves again a script that we should be able to run.

We're gonna do that now. So I bring up a new terminal window. Here we go.

I'm gonna do scripts/start-mac.shell. Okay, it's building something, it's done, it started it, it says, oh right here, let's open this up, here we go, click on here, up it comes, it looks the same but we know it's running through this bigger infrastructure now, and I guess we could just quickly check that if we do New York that it appears over on the right, it does seem to, and what about the downloading, is this still going to work? Yep, that still seems to work.

Here we go. Here are my downloads, recent download. And there it is.

### Deep dive

Fine. It's all working. It's a that's great on a different route on local hosted 8000.

It's it's coming through just great. Amazing. Okay, so back we come here and yeah, we can we can see see that tons and tons of stuff has been built, I forgot backend and routes and lots of things here.

Okay, so now I'm going to say, please merge the PR locally and push to main and switch branch to main. Let's make that happen. And then at the end of this, off it goes, it's doing all of its things.

And what are we gonna do next? We're just gonna go push ahead and do PL5, the next of our actions. So this is of course a bigger one.

I'm just gonna go up here, feature dev implement, geo-ticket PL5 and make a PL. Maybe before we should do this. Not so fast, not so fast.

Let's look at context, always look at the context. Let's take a look. How are we doing here?

Scroll up, look at that, it is pretty full. Why don't we do something a bit different? Why don't we say, please update, add, add, add some concise details to the end of claud.md with an update on what has been implemented.

And change anything that's no longer accurate in cloud.md because I remember there's a section at the top when we say this is what we've got. Okay, so let it do that because we're going to want to now reset it to do the next one. And this is a good practice because if we just leave it going, it's going to fill up the rest of the context, then it's going to do a compact.

And as it does that compact, it's always a bit risky. What you tend to find is that it selectively forgets some of the things that did really matter from things like Claude.md in its attempt to squash everything down. So people are, people are afraid of compacting for good reason.

You get used to this kind of fear of the compact once you've done this for a while because performance tends to degrade after it. All right, now we've done that. Let's go and have a look at claw.md.

Let's see what we've got here. Open preview. And this is SAS product, the current rotation sports.

Okay, with no development progress. It's all good. It hasn't messed this up.

It still says use your skill, color scheme, implemented status. Okay, good, good, good, good. All right, fabulous.

Now, now we can start again with Clorico. We can clear the context with clear conscience and then get on with the next one. So we will get on with that.

So I'm gonna do slash clear. There we go. No content.

It's all gone. Contacts, let's have a look at it, nice and fresh. It's of course still got that memory in there.

You can see that the memory file is 1.8K tokens. It's got a little bit in there. So we've got some stuff in there.

Now if I go up, up, up, here we go. Implement Jira ticket PL5 and make a PR, but we may need to reauthenticate. Should we just give it a try and let's see what happens if it's able to read Jira or whether it's going to get stuck.

Let me see, we'll do this. I think this is a good sign. This is what happens when it gets stuck.

It just stays like this. When this happens, it means it needs me to reauthenticate. So if this happens to you, that's what's going on.

I know this from bitter personal experience. So you press escape to interrupt like that. And now we've interrupted, we do slash mcp, and we come into our mcp servers, we go into Atlassian, we're going to re-authenticate, up comes this approve, and back down here, except that is now done, return to Cloud Code, back we go.

You see I'm pretty quick at this now. Here we go, try again. Now I think we'll find it, we'll be able to do it quite fast.

### Putting it together

Running, and it's off. There we go. Okay, I'll see you in a second.

Okay, so it's asking me questions, and they are really great questions, and these are the kinds of questions that you might go back and ask your business sponsor or product person. If you were trying to code this, should the chat UI completely replace the form or coexist with it so your user can switch between the chat and the form view? I think number one, replace the form entirely.

We want to chat UI. That is the new way of doing things. So it's just going to be number one.

That is it. One, should the document preview live updates or only after these are live updates? For sure.

Number one, how should the AI conversation begin? AI greets and asks first question. Yes, let's do that.

When all the required fields are filled in, what should happen? AI confirms and showed download. The, that sounds right.

Yes, one. Okay, submit answers. Great questions.

Really good questions. They are like the sorts of things that one would ask typically. So yeah, this process, this anthropic built process to guide you through really does seem to work.

Next up is going to be the architecture design and it'll ask me some architecture questions. Okay, it's responded with the architecture set up. Let's have a look at what it's saying.

So it is saying before designing the architecture, I have a few questions about the implementation. So here we go. Phase four, let me launch this.

All three architecture approaches are complete. So it launched three different agents, minimal, clean and pragmatic. Minimal changes, replace NDA form with chat interface, reuse everything else, stateless, backend, sure, okay.

Clean architecture, full session management, database persistence, SSE, no, we don't want that, definitely not. Pragmatic balance, streaming responses, parallel field extraction, stateless,-end clean, blah, blah, blah, two parallel, one for structured feature, good UX, simple to implement. Let me see.

That's a difficult one. I actually, I don't particularly think we need streaming because we're using some rebrass, which is so fast that streaming is not gonna be required, and I'd rather we just have the structured extraction. I think I'm going to go for the minimal one.

I'm going to go here for two, is going to let me chat about it. Yeah, I guess I'm going to chat about this. chat about this.

Say chat about this, okay. Okay, so would you like to clarify, I'd like the simple back at the pragmatic choice, except I only want one LLAM call and no streaming because cerebras is so fast that streaming isn't necessary. One LLAM call with structured outputs, including the response, is cleaner.

There we go. That's what we're going with. So it's a conversation.

Let's see what it's thinking. It's thinking about that. Let's see what it likes about that.

And hopefully it will build this, but this is the kind of thing. That makes sense. So we're just extremely fast in a single structure up of course as with a response text.

And the extra fields is cleaner. Let me update the approach. Great.

So I like that interaction. I like the fact that it made me think. You could see my coke wheels were turning there.

And I was a decent question. It was a good debate. I could see why it would think that streaming would be a better experience.

But I do think from my knowledge of Saribras, it's so fast that it would just be like zipping through.

## Walkthrough

This session walks through the material step by step. Use the notes below as a study guide while you rewatch or practice alongside the original lesson.

It's pulling PL4 and things are happening. I will see you back here in a bit. I know I'm going to be amazed and shocked.

## Practical tips

- Let's look at context, always look at the context. Let's take a look. How are we doing here?
- Scroll up, look at that, it is pretty full. Why don't we do something a bit different? Why don't we say, please update, add, add, add some concise details to the end of claud.md with an update on what has been implemented.
- And change anything that's no longer accurate in cloud.md because I remember there's a section at the top when we say this is what we've got. Okay, so let it do that because we're going to want to now reset it to do the next one. And this is a good practice because if we just leave it going, it's going to fill up the rest of the context, then it's going to do a compact.
- And as it does that compact, it's always a bit risky. What you tend to find is that it selectively forgets some of the things that did really matter from things like Claude.md in its attempt to squash everything down. So people are, people are afraid of compacting for good reason.

## Common pitfalls

- Skipping setup steps called out early in the lesson
- Copying outcomes without understanding the workflow behind them
- Running ahead without verifying intermediate results

## Summary

It wouldn't be necessary and it would be extra complexity for little benefit. So I'd rather stick with simpler there. Okay, it's going on to implementation. I will see you in a second when implementation is complete.
